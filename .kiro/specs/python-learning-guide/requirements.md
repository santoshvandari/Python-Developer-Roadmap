# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Python learning guide (README.md) that serves as a complete resource for learning Python programming from beginner to advanced level. The guide will include structured content, practical code examples, syntax explanations, and progressive learning paths to help users master Python programming concepts systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a beginner programmer, I want a structured introduction to Python basics, so that I can understand fundamental concepts and start writing simple programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the guide THEN the system SHALL provide a clear introduction to Python and its applications
2. WHEN a user reads the basics section THEN the system SHALL include syntax for variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output
3. WHEN a user encounters code examples THEN the system SHALL provide runnable code snippets with explanations
4. WHEN a user needs to understand data types THEN the system SHALL cover strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries with examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learning programmer, I want to understand control structures and functions, so that I can write more complex and organized programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user studies control flow THEN the system SHALL include if/else statements, loops (for, while), and break/continue with examples
2. WHEN a user learns about functions THEN the system SHALL cover function definition, parameters, return values, and scope
3. WHEN a user encounters error handling THEN the system SHALL include try/except blocks and common exception types
4. WHEN a user needs to understand code organization THEN the system SHALL cover modules and packages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an intermediate programmer, I want to learn object-oriented programming and advanced concepts, so that I can build more sophisticated applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user studies OOP THEN the system SHALL include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
2. WHEN a user learns advanced features THEN the system SHALL cover decorators, generators, context managers, and lambda functions
3. WHEN a user needs file handling THEN the system SHALL include reading/writing files and working with different file formats
4. WHEN a user studies data structures THEN the system SHALL cover advanced collections and algorithms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an advanced learner, I want to understand professional Python development practices, so that I can write production-quality code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user learns about libraries THEN the system SHALL include popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Requests, and Flask/Django
2. WHEN a user studies best practices THEN the system SHALL cover PEP 8, testing, virtual environments, and package management
3. WHEN a user needs debugging skills THEN the system SHALL include debugging techniques and tools
4. WHEN a user wants to advance further THEN the system SHALL provide resources for specialized areas like web development, data science, and automation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a self-directed learner, I want a well-organized and navigable guide, so that I can easily find information and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the guide THEN the system SHALL provide a clear table of contents with links to sections
2. WHEN a user reads any section THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and clear headings
3. WHEN a user encounters code examples THEN the system SHALL use proper syntax highlighting and include expected outputs
4. WHEN a user completes a section THEN the system SHALL provide practice exercises or next steps where appropriate
