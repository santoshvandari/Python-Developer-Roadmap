## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Guidelines

#### 1. Educational Focus

- Content should be educational and beginner-friendly
- Explain concepts clearly with practical examples
- Build upon previous concepts progressively
- Include real-world applications when possible

#### 2. Accuracy and Quality

- All code examples must be tested and working
- Use Python 3.8+ syntax and features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include expected output for code examples

#### 3. Consistency

- Follow the existing structure and formatting
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Maintain the same tone and style as existing content
- Follow the established naming conventions

### Code Examples Guidelines

#### 1. Code Quality

```python
# Good: Clear, commented, and educational
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compound_frequency=1):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
        principal (float): Initial amount
        rate (float): Annual interest rate (as decimal)
        time (float): Time period in years
        compound_frequency (int): Compounding frequency per year

    Returns:
        float: Final amount after compound interest
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate / compound_frequency) ** (compound_frequency * time)
    return round(amount, 2)

# Example usage
initial_amount = 1000
interest_rate = 0.05  # 5%
years = 2

final_amount = calculate_compound_interest(initial_amount, interest_rate, years, 4)
print(f"${initial_amount} becomes ${final_amount} after {years} years")
# Output: $1000 becomes $1104.89 after 2 years
```

#### 2. Code Structure

- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Add comments explaining complex logic
- Show expected output for examples
- Handle edge cases and errors appropriately
- Use meaningful variable names

#### 3. Progressive Complexity

- Start with simple examples
- Build complexity gradually
- Reference previous concepts
- Provide variations and alternatives

### File Organization

#### 1. Roadmap Files

- Each major topic should have its own file in the `Roadmap/` directory
- Use numbered prefixes for sequential topics (e.g., `01-getting-started.md`)
- Include navigation links to related topics

#### 2. File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `advanced-features.md`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Follow the existing naming pattern


## Content Standards

### Writing Style

- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Assume no prior programming knowledge for beginner sections
- **Practical**: Focus on practical applications and real-world examples
- **Encouraging**: Maintain a positive, supportive tone

### Formatting Standards

- Use proper Markdown syntax
- Include code syntax highlighting
- Use consistent heading levels
- Add table of contents for longer sections
- Include navigation links between related topics
