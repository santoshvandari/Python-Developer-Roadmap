# Password Generator Project

Create a secure password generator with customizable options for different security requirements.

## Project Overview

**What you'll build**: A password generator that creates random, secure passwords with various customization options including length, character types, and complexity rules.

**What you'll learn**:
- String manipulation and character sets
- Random number generation and selection
- User input validation
- File operations for saving passwords
- Security best practices for passwords

## Project Features

### Basic Features
- Generate random passwords of specified length
- Include/exclude different character types (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Basic user interface for password generation
- Display generated password to user

### Advanced Features
- Password strength evaluation
- Save generated passwords to file
- Bulk password generation
- Custom character sets
- Password history and management
- GUI interface option

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Basic Password Generator
**Time**: 1-2 hours

Create a simple password generator:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12):
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

# Usage
password = generate_password(16)
print(f"Generated password: {password}")
```

**Key concepts**: Random selection, string concatenation, loops

### Phase 2: Customizable Generator
**Time**: 2-3 hours

Add customization options:
- Choose password length
- Select character types to include
- Exclude similar characters (0, O, l, I)
- Ensure minimum requirements (at least one number, symbol, etc.)

**Key concepts**: Functions with parameters, conditional logic, input validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Time**: 3-4 hours

Implement additional functionality:
- Password strength checker
- Save passwords to encrypted file
- Generate multiple passwords at once
- Memorable password options (using words)

**Key concepts**: File operations, encryption basics, data structures

### Phase 4: GUI Application
**Time**: 4-5 hours

Create a graphical interface:
- Checkboxes for character type selection
- Slider for password length
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Password history display

**Key concepts**: GUI programming, event handling, clipboard operations

## Getting Started

### Setup
1. Create a new project directory
2. Set up your Python environment
3. Import required modules (random, string, tkinter for GUI)

### Basic Structure
```python
import random
import string

class PasswordGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lowercase = string.ascii_lowercase
        self.uppercase = string.ascii_uppercase
        self.digits = string.digits
        self.symbols = string.punctuation
    
    def generate(self, length, use_lowercase=True, use_uppercase=True, 
                 use_digits=True, use_symbols=True):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

## Testing Your Generator

### Test Cases
- Generate passwords of different lengths (8, 12, 16, 32 characters)
- Test with different character set combinations
- Verify password strength requirements
- Test edge cases (minimum length, maximum length)
- Ensure randomness (generate multiple passwords, check for patterns)

### Security Considerations
- Use cryptographically secure random number generation for production
- Never log or store passwords in plain text
- Implement proper clipboard clearing
- Consider password expiration recommendations

## Extensions and Improvements

### Beginner Extensions
- Passphrase generator using word lists
- Password strength visualization
- Export passwords to different formats
- Command line interface

### Intermediate Extensions
- Integration with password managers
- Web interface using Flask
- Password policy compliance checker
- Bulk generation with CSV export

### Advanced Extensions
- Secure password storage with encryption
- Multi-language word support for passphrases
- API for password generation service
- Browser extension for password generation

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Passwords not random enough
**Solution**: Use `secrets` module instead of `random` for cryptographic randomness

**Issue**: Generated passwords don't meet requirements
**Solution**: Implement validation and regeneration logic

**Issue**: GUI freezes during bulk generation
**Solution**: Use threading for long-running operations

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you'll understand:
- How to work with random number generation
- String manipulation and character sets
- User input validation and error handling
- Basic security principles for password generation
- GUI application development
- File operations and data persistence
